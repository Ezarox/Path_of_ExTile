Maze Game Diagnostic Functions:



Run multiple seeds. Example:
  evaluateAiSeed("3270")
  evaluateSeedBatch(seeds, runs=1)
  evaluateSeedBatch("318495518 696921118", 1)

Adjust/restore weights. Example:
  setAiWeights(obj), resetAiWeights()
  setAiWeights({ pathTime: 2.0, slowTime: 1.2 })

Weight exploration tools. Examples:
  sweepAiWeights(seed, samples=50, options={}), tuneAiWeights, tuneAiWeightsForSeeds, sampleWeightsVariant
  sweepAiWeights("318495518", 10, { runs: 1 })
  sweepAiWeights("318495518", 40, {runs: 1, varyOnly: "slowInteraction", ranges: { slowInteraction: 1 }})
  tuneAiWeights("318495518", 8, { range: 1.2 })
  tuneAiWeightsForSeeds(["A","B"], 10, { range: 0.5 })
  tuneAiWeightsForSeeds(["a-mazing-race","a-mazing-game","18112025","3270"], 40, { range: 1, runs: 5, minWeight: 0.01 })

Inspect a grid’s score/predicted time. Example:
  previewGridMetrics(state.aiGrid, { type: "lightning", x: 10, y: 17 })
  previewGridMetrics(state.playerGrid, { type: "lightning", x: 10, y: 17 })
  previewGridMetrics(state.aiGrid, { type: "lightning", x: 10, y: 17 })

Return the last AI build profiling info (totalMs, placementMs, specialMs, reclaimMs, placements, lookaheadUsed)
  getAiProfile()

Return placement order, block importance:
  state.aiPlacementOrder

Return maze:
  JSON.stringify(state.playerGrid)
  JSON.stringify(state.aiGrid)

Return current weight object. Example: getAiWeights()
  getAiWeights()

Current weights:
  pathTime
  specialTime
  neutralSpecialTime
  slowTime
  slowStack
  slowInteraction
  blockUsage
  lightningPadPenalty
  beamCrossings

Forcing coding agent back on track:
  You are helping me refactor a small personal game project. I use git and am happy to fix broken builds.

  Hard rules for you:
  1. It is OK to break the build.
  2. Never say a task is "too big", "too risky", or that you "don’t have time".
  3. Never say "I have to stop here", "I’m going to stop here", or that you’ll "continue off-screen".
  4. When I say "proceed", you MUST output code changes, not plans.
  5. Prefer showing full updated files or a unified diff over explanations.

  If you are unsure, still attempt the change and show the result.
  Do NOT narrate safety concerns. Just do the work.
